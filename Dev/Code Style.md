#Code Style for Pythonic Developer#

One important design goal of the Python programming language is readability. 
The coding motto is: 

> Anyone can write code a computer can understand,
but professional developers write code humans can understand.

When in doubt, always put **maintainability** as your top priority. 
The code style in this document is based on the following resources.
